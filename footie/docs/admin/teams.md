# Managing Teams

Teams are the foundation of your competitions. You can add teams with player rosters, contact information, and distinctive colours for easy identification.

Navigate to **Admin > Teams** to see all your teams.

The teams list shows:

### Required Fields

**Team Name** (required)

Enter the team's name as you want it to appear in fixtures and tables.

Examples:

The system automatically generates a URL-friendly slug from the team name.

**Email Address**

An email address for team communications.

Enter a valid email address (e.g., "john@example.com").

You can:

- Use the colour picker to select any colour
- Click **Quick Pick Team Colour** to choose from professional team colours organised by league

The hex colour value displays next to the picker. The default colour is a dark green (#1a5f2a).

**Players**

Enter player names for the team roster, one name per line.

Example:

```

The player list is for record-keeping and reference. You can add, edit, or remove players at any time.

## Editing a Team

Click on a team name to view its full details. The team detail page shows:

From the detail page, you can:

2. Click **Delete** next to the team
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted

Deleting a team permanently removes it from the system. This action cannot be undone.

## Managing Team Colours

Team colours help you quickly identify teams in fixture lists and tables. Choose distinctive colours that make teams easy to tell apart.

### Using the Colour Picker

The selected colour displays as a hex value (e.g., #1a5f2a).

### Quick Pick Feature

Click **Quick Pick Team Colour** to reveal pre-set colours from professional football leagues:

- Premier League teams

- Scottish Premiership teams
- And more

Click any team chip to apply that colour instantly. This is useful for choosing recognisable, distinctive colours.

The selected colour highlights with a border when you choose it.

## Managing Player Rosters

The **Players** field accepts a simple list of names, one per line.

The system stores exactly what you enter.

## Tips for Managing Teams

**Consistent Naming**

Use consistent naming conventions across all teams. If you use "FC" for one team, consider using it for all football club teams.

**Distinctive Colours**

Choose colours that look different from each other. Avoid using similar shades (like light blue and dark blue) for teams that might play against each other.

**Contact Information**

Keep contact details up to date. This information helps you reach team representatives quickly when you need to communicate fixture changes.

**Player Rosters**

Update player lists at the start of each season. You can add or remove players at any time without affecting results or fixtures.

**Team Organisation**

If you manage different age groups or divisions, include that in the team name (e.g., "Red Lions U16" or "St Mary's Reserves").

## Using Teams in Competitions

After creating teams, you can add them to leagues and cups:

- When creating a league, select which teams participate
- When creating a cup, choose teams to include in the draw
- You can add the same team to multiple competitions

Teams must exist before you can create competitions. Create all your teams first, then set up leagues and cups.

## Next Steps

After adding teams:

- [Create a league](leagues.md) with your teams
- [Create a cup](cups.md) tournament
- [Manage fixtures](fixtures.md) for team matches
